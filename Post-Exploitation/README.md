# Security Research Collection 🔐

Hello! Welcome to my personal collection of security research, cheat sheets, and penetration testing resources. I've been collecting and refining these over the years through various engagements, CTFs, and late-night research sessions.

## What's Inside? 📚

This repository contains practical guides and cheat sheets that I actually use in the field. No fluff, just stuff that works when you need it to.

### 🪟 Windows Post-Exploitation
- **[Windows Post-Exploitation Cheat Sheet](Windows Post Exploitation Cheatsheet.md)** - Everything you need for Windows post-exploitation, from user creation to RDP setup. Includes both red team techniques and blue team detection methods.

### 🚀 Payload Generation & Shells
- **[MSFVenom Cheat Sheet](msfvenom-cheatsheet.md)** - Comprehensive guide to MSFVenom payload generation with evasion techniques and practical examples.
- **[PHP Reverse Shell Guide](php-reverse-shell-guide.md)** - Enhanced PHP reverse shells with obfuscation, multi-connection support, and deployment strategies.
- **[Python Reverse Shell Guide](python-reverse-shell-guide.md)** - From basic one-liners to advanced cross-platform shells with persistence and stealth features.

### ⚡ PowerShell for Security
- **[PowerShell Pentesting Cheat Sheet](powershell-pentesting-cheatsheet.md)** - PowerShell commands for both offensive and defensive operations, including post-exploitation techniques and forensics.

### 🎯 Post-Exploitation Resources
- **[Post-Exploitation Resources](post-exploitation-resources.md)** - Curated collection of lateral movement techniques, C2 frameworks, privilege escalation methods, and persistence mechanisms.

## Why I Built This 🤔

After years of bookmarking random blog posts, saving code snippets in random text files, and constantly Googling the same commands, I decided to organize everything in one place. These aren't just copy-pasted resources - I've tested most of these techniques in lab environments and real engagements.

## How to Use This 💡

Each guide is designed to be:
- **Practical** - Real commands you can copy and paste
- **Comprehensive** - Covers both basic and advanced techniques  
- **Educational** - Includes explanations, not just commands
- **Responsible** - Contains proper legal disclaimers and ethical guidelines

## A Word on Ethics ⚖️

Everything in this repository is intended for:
- ✅ Authorized penetration testing
- ✅ Security research and education
- ✅ Improving defensive capabilities
- ✅ CTF competitions and labs

**Never use these techniques on systems you don't own or lack explicit permission to test.** Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical. Always get proper written authorization before conducting any security testing.

## Disclaimer 📝

These resources are provided for educational and authorized testing purposes only. I assume no responsibility for misuse of this information. The techniques described here should only be used in environments where you have explicit permission to test.
